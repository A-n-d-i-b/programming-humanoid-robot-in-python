# Week 4: Hands On Robot
This week you need to implement distributed computing via remote procedure call (RPC, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), which has similiar interface you get with real robot via PyNaoQi.

The server and client have to be implemented together:
* ./agent_server.py provides remote RPC service;
* ./agent_client.py request remote call from server and provide non-blocking capibility.
